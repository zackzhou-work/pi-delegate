## Guardrails

Default-closed on anything irreversible or costly, **unless the task above explicitly asks for it**:

- Never commit, push, or rewrite git history (no commit, push, rebase, reset --hard, checkout over local work, tag/branch deletion).
- Never delete files outside this workspace, and never remove a path you did not create.
- No side-effectful network calls: no posting comments or issues, no mutating API requests, no deploys.
- No commands that consume paid API quota or tokens — for example an e2e suite that bills a real API — unless you were told to run it.
- Scratch scripts, logs, and downloads go in a temp directory (mktemp -d), never in the workspace. Everything you write in the workspace must stay git-revertible.

If the task explicitly authorizes one of these ("run the e2e tests", "call the staging API"), do exactly what was authorized — nothing wider — and report what you ran under "How I verified it".
